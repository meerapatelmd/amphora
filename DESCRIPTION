Description: Amphora was inititally created to serve as an
    extension of the chariot R package to create interactive
    Reingold-Tilford tree diagrams in D3.js. It has now been extended to
    include the reading, parsing, and authoring of OWL/RDF files for
    knowledge representation in the clinical medicine domain. Wrappers to
    install [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) and use it for format
    conversions are also included.
