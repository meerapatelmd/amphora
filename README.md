# amphora Package <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120"  

Amphora is an extension of the chariot R package that creates 
Reingold-Tilford tree diagrams in D3.js. This package branched off from
the [chariot R package](https://meerapatelmd.github.io/chariot), which 
is moreover centered around querying data rather than visualizing it.
