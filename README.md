Amphora was inititally created to serve as an extension of the chariot R
package to create interactive Reingold-Tilford tree diagrams in D3.js.
It has now been extended to include the reading, parsing, and authoring
of hierarchies files for knowledge representation in the clinical
medicine domain. Wrappers to install
[ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) and use it for format conversions
are also included.

Related packages include
[chariot](https://meerapatelmd.github.io/chariot) as mentioned, and
[mOMOP](https://meerapatelmd.github.io/mOMOP) which is used to create
the OWL class hierarchy of the minimal oncology data elements in mCode.
